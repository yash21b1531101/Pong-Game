# Pong-Game
Players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen. A ball bounces back and forth between the paddles, which players use to hit it towards the opponent's side. The goal is to prevent the ball from going past your paddle and score points. First player to reach a specific score (usually 11 points) wins.
